Text analysis is a diverse area of research focused on extracting meaningful information from written language using linguistic, computational and statistical techniques. It is utilised in many different areas such as authorship recognition, document classification and sociolinguistic analysis. Overall this area of research aims to see language in a structured form which features distinct patterns and similarities enabling it to be unique and identifiable.

Language models play a crucial role in modern text analysis, they enable probabilistics or learned representations of language. Syntactic language models capture the distributions of grammatical constructions rather than surface word counts which has been particularly effective at distinguishing between books (Uzuner et al, 2005). This analysis method achieved higher accuracy, indicating that structural patterns are more stable indicators than topical vocabulary.

Textual features are also highly important in text analysis. Textual features refer to the visual and spatial characteristics of texts. These capture global writing style, which makes it easier to identify individual authors (Bulacu et al, 2007). Further run-length and inclination distribution features have also been analysed to classify structural regularities in text, the rhythm and repetition of these features are also a strong personal marker for identification of authors (Marti et al, 2010).
