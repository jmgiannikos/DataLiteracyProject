# DataLiteracyProject
## Usage
- The Author Pages folder contains the html of the article export page of a given author (example: https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_mandates_page_export&hl=en&user=MUg_qAYAAAAJ). This has to be collected manually currently, as google scholar blocks automated requests.
- playfground.py file contains a brief pipeline, that fetches all articles for a given author page. Note: before that works, one should make sure the folders "processed_tex_sources/" and "tex_sources/" exist in the main project folder.
- to see some example visualisations run visualize_results.py after running playfground.py
