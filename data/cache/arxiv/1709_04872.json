  "summary": "Stellar rotation is a key in our understanding of both mass-loss and evolution of intermediate and massive stars. It can lead to anisotropic mass-loss in the form of radiative wind or an excretion disk. We wished to spatially resolve the photosphere and gaseous environment of 51 Oph, a peculiar star with a very high vsin(i) of 267km s$^{-1}$ and an evolutionary status that remains unsettled. It has been classified by different authors as a Herbig, a $\u03b2$ Pic, or a classical Be star. We used the VEGA visible beam combiner installed on the CHARA array that reaches a submilliarcsecond resolution. Observation were centered on the H$\u03b1$ emission line. We derived, for the first time, the extension and flattening of 51 Oph photosphere. We found a major axis of $\u03b8_{\\mathrm{eq}}$=8.08$\\pm$0.70$R_\\odot$ and a minor axis of $\u03b8_{\\mathrm{pol}}$=5.66$\\pm$0.23$R_\\odot$ .\n  This high photosphere distortion shows that the star is rotating close to its critical velocity. Finally, using spectro-interferometric measurements in the H$ \u03b1$ line, we constrained the circumstellar environment geometry and kinematics and showed that the emission is produced in a 5.2$\\pm$2R$_{*}$ disk in Keplerian rotation. From the visible point of view, 51 Oph presents all the features of a classical Be star: near critical-rotation and double-peaked H$\u03b1$ line in emission produced in a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation. However, this does not explain the presence of dust as seen in the mid-infrared and millimeter spectra, and the evolutionary status of 51 Oph remains unsettled.",
