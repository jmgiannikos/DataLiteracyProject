  "summary": "CubeSats are tiny satellites with increasing capabilities. They have been used for more than a decade by universities to train students on space technologies, in a hands-on project aiming at building, launching and operating a real satellite. Still today, one shortcoming of CubeSats is their poor ability to transmit large amounts of data to the ground. A possible way to overcome this limitation relies on optical communications. Universite Cote d'Azur is studying the feasibility of a student's CubeSat whose main goal is to transmit data with an optical link to the ground at the moderate rate of 1 kb/s (or better). In this paper, we will present the current state of the project and its future developments.",
