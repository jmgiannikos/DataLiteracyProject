  "summary": "The Interferometric studies of novae in the optical and near-infrared is a nascent but fast emerging field which has begun to provide new and invaluable insights into the nova phenomenon. This is particularly so in the early stages of the eruption when all the relevant physical phenomena are on the scale of milli-arcseconds and thus are amenable to be studied only by interferometric techniques. In this review the instruments and arrays involved in this domain of work are briefly described, followed by a description of the major results obtained so far. A discussion is made of the physical aspects, where the application of interferometric techniques, can bring the most valuable information. Finally, prospects for the near future are discussed.",
