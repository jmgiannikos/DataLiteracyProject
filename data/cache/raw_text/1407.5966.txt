v838 monocerotis erupted in 2002, brightened in a series of
  outbursts, and eventually developed a spectacular light echo. a very
  red star emerged a few months after the outburst. the whole event
  has been interpreted as the result of a merger.
we obtained near-ir and mid-ir interferometric observations of
  v838 mon with the amber and midi
  recombiners located at the very large telescope interferometer
  (vlti) array. the midi two-beam observations were
  obtained with the 8m unit telescopes between october 2011 and
  february 2012. the amber three-beam observations were
  obtained  with the compact array (b35m) in april
  2013 and the long array (b140m) in may 2014, using the 1.8m
  auxiliary telescopes.
a significant new result is the detection of a compact structure
  around v838 mon, as seen from midi data. the
  extension of the structure increases from a fwhm of 25 mas at
  8  to 70 mas at 13 .
  at the adopted distance of  kpc, the dust is
  distributed from about 150 to 400 au around v838 mon. the
  midi visibilities reveal a flattened structure whose aspect
  ratio increases with wavelength. the major axis is roughly oriented
  around a position angle of , which aligns with previous
  polarimetric studies reported in the
  literature. this flattening can be interpreted as a relic of the
  2002 eruption or by the influence of the currently embedded b3v
  companion. the amber data provide a new diameter for the
  pseudo-photosphere, which shows that its diameter has decreased by
  about 40% in 10yrs, reaching a radius   ( au).
after the  2002 eruption, interpreted as the merging of two 
  stars, it seems that the resulting source is relaxing to a normal
  state. the nearby environment exhibits an equatorial over-density of
  dust up to several hundreds of au.

§ introduction
v838 mon is a nova-like object, which erupted in 2002 in a
series of outbursts (reaching v6.8). it subsequently developed a
light echo which was extensively studied by
. the eruption was unlike classical novae as the
effective temperature of the object dropped and the spectral type
evolved into a very late l-type supergiant . the event has been interpreted as the merger of a
8 star with a sub-solar mass star
. the mid infrared flux of v838 mon increased by
a factor of two between 2004 and 2007, suggesting that new dust was
forming in the expanding ejecta of the outbursts
. the expanding ejecta engulfed a 
companion close to the central source .
the progenitor of v838 mon was found in a variety of
surveys, including 2mass, and appears consistent with a somewhat
reddened early main sequence star. post-outburst observations have
found a faint, blue component in the spectrum and
 argued that the pre-outburst spectral
energy distribution (sed) is well-matched by a pair of early main
sequence stars (b3v + b1.5v or b4v + a0.5v), making v838 mon a triple
system de facto (main star + sub-solar merging star + b3v
companion).  obtained numerous ir spectra
of v838 mon during and after the eruption (2002-2003). they
fit their data to a model consisting of a cool (t = 2100k,
r au) stellar photosphere surrounded by a large, absorbing
molecular cloud. a more recent work  provides
precise estimates of the stellar and enshrouding cloud parameters,
with an effective temperature of the star of 2000–2200 k, and a
radius of the shell of  au.
first used long-baseline near-ir
(2.2   baselines smaller than 85 m) interferometry in
november-december 2004 to provide the first direct measurement of the
angular size of v838 mon using the two-telescope recombiner
palomar testbed instrument (pti). at this epoch, they measured 
an angular diameter for the central source of  mas.
reasonably accurate distances were determined from the light echo and
using other methods . we adopt the distance  kpc
from . using this distance, the
interferometric diameter translates to a linear radius for the
supergiant of   ( au).  could also fit the data
assuming an elliptical structure with a major axis oriented at
p.a.  whose extensions are  mas (i.e. the
minor axis is unresolved).
v838 mon is embedded in a dense, large scale environment
,
potentially contaminating observations of the central star. high
angular resolution studies with a field-of-view (fov) of a few arcsec
are an asset in that domain to isolate the central regions from the
extended dusty cloud. a great advantage of optical interferometry
studies is to fully isolate the measurements from the extended
environment.
this letter presents optical interferometry measurements obtained with
the very large telescope interferometer (vlti). the observations are
presented in sect. . in sect.  we
analyze the midi mid-ir measurements followed by the amber  band measurements by means of simple geometrical
models. the results are then discussed in sect. .
§ observations
mid-ir interferometric data were obtained with the two-telescope
recombiner midi  between october
2011 and february 2012 using the 8m unit telescopes (uts) of the very
large telescope. these observations provided dispersed fringe
visibilities between 8 and 13  in addition to classical
spectrophotometric capabilities.
near-infrared observations were obtained with amber <cit.> in november 2012 and february 2013,
using the low spectral resolution mode (r=35) with the
uts. unfortunately, these data are unusable due to a bad calibrator
(see details in appendix ) and therefore not presented
here.
in april 2013, observations were repeated with the 1.8m auxiliary
telescopes (ats) under photometric conditions, using the compact
configuration (m) and more suitable calibrators. the extended
configuration (m) was subsequently used in may 2014 to
observe v838 mon.
left: () coverage of the amber observations. small
    dots are observations with ats and larger circles with uts.
    right: () coverage of the midi observations.
    
the great advantage of both instruments is that the fov of the
interferometric measurements are within the point spread function of a
single telescope, i.e. the same value of 0.3 at
2.2  for the 1.8m ats with amber, and at
10  for the 8m uts with midi. this isolates the central
source from the extended emission of the cloud in which
v838 mon is embedded. the observation log is presented in
table  and the () plane coverage is plotted in
fig..
we reduced the amber data using the standard data reduction
software amdlib v3.0.8 . near-infrared  photometry was obtained on
a regular basis from the 1.2m telescope at the mt. abu observatory,
india . these measurements helped to prepare the
interferometric observations. on march 1, 2013, the , ,  band
magnitudes were 7.12, 5.91, 5.43, respectively, almost unchanged since
november 2011.

visibilities are a proxy to the object's size and shape. the amber
visibilities are presented in fig.  at selected
wavelengths for all baselines, and for the longest baseline in
fig.  together with the jhk mt. abu spectrum. strong
variations as a function of wavelength are seen, especially at the
edge of the  and  bands where they decrease relative to the
bands centers (1.7  and 2.2 ). all baseline lengths
show this curved shape.
we are confident this is not a flux bias or instrumental effect,
but comes from the source itself.

    selected wavelengths. the black line shows our best-fit model of a uniform
    disk plus an extended component (50 mas fwhm here).
  
closure phases can be qualitatively interpreted as a proxy to
asymmetries: a non-zero (modulo ) closure phase is a sign of
asymmetries in the object's shape.
the 2014 closure phases are of good quality and compatible with zero
with a mean value of . the object is therefore
likely centro-symmetric as seen by amber. the spectral-range of the
amber data is 1.5–2.5 .
the midi data were processed using the mia+ews
software[http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/nevec/midi/]
. the data were secured in high_sens mode
implying that the photometry is obtained subsequently to fringes. the
quality of the data ranges from high quality (error level 10%)
to poor quality for some baselines (error level reaching
25%). the spectrophotometric calibration of the mid-ir flux was
performed with the calibrator hd 52666 (m2iii, iras
f12=18.3 jy with a 5% error). the ten midi spectra from two
telescopes were merged leading to a spectrophotometry with an 8%
error level, representing the mid-ir flux of the source between
october and february 2011. the spectrum was compared with measurements
at the same epoch from the wise[taken in april 2 and
  october 10, 2010] and akari[obtained between
    may 2006 and august 2007] satellites obtained with much larger
  apertures. the flux in the wise filter (  ,  ) is
  31.560.06 jy and in the akari filter (  ,  ) the flux is
  20.110.39 jy. the spectrophotometry and the corresponding
  gaussian estimates from the midi are shown in
  fig..

§ analysis
the midi dispersed visibilities were translated to the
simplest possible geometrical ad-hoc model – a gaussian brightness
distribution, as described in . the
resulting fits shown in fig.  depict the general
appearance of the mid-infrared structure. the semi-major and
semi-minor axes of the drawn ellipses represent the half-width at half
maximum (hwhm) of the gaussian. the extent of that structure increases
from a fwhm of 25 mas at 8  to 70 mas at 13 , with
a high flattening ratio. despite the heterogeneity of the quality of
the midi visibilities, the flattening of that structure is
certain, but we can only provide a loose range for flattening ratio
values between 1.1 and 2.5 near 9 , and between 1.3 and 60
near 12 . the major axis is oriented at a p.a. close to
 with an uncertainty of more than . the
flattening increases with the wavelength, from a roughly round
structure at 8  to a very flattened structure at
13 . this may come from the contribution of the star, stronger
at 8 . the flux from wise agrees fairly well with the
midi flux. akari data is offset in time from the
  midi data by 5 to 6 years. given that the source's sed has been
  evolving in the ir  it is not unexpected
  or surprising that there is some difference in the value of the 9
  micron flux measured by akari and midi.  this implies that most of
the mid-ir flux in 2011 originates from the vicinity of the central
star (”).
the 2013 short-baseline amber visibilities are all very close to
unity in the band centers at 1.7  and 2.2  and are
consistent with a completely unresolved object. the long-baseline,
2014 visibilities are close to  at the same wavelengths.
the visibilities as a function of wavelength of the  and 
  bands decrease relative to the bands centers (1.7  and
  2.2 ), as shown in fig. . this is indicative of
  an object whose shape changes as a function of wavelength. at the
  same time, the visibilities at the edge of the bands (1.5 ,
  2.0  and 2.4 ) show a “plateau-like” shape as a
  function of spatial frequencies (see fig. ),
  indicative of an additional resolved component. we therefore
  analysed first the  band center using a single-component model,
  and then added an additional component to analyze the full amber
  dataset.
top: midi spectrum obtained in 2011. we
     added for comparison akari (triangle) and wise
     (square) fluxes. bottom: 2d gaussian fit to the whole midi dataset. the dashed lines represent the direction of
     the observation baselines. 
we used the  software  to
derive an angular diameter assuming a uniform disk model around
2.2. if we include all the 2013 (short baselines) and 2014
(long baselines) observations, we find a diameter of
 mas. if we keep only the 2014 data, we obtain a
diameter of  mas.
we adopt the latter diameter of  mas as the 2013 data
(short baselines) do not resolve the central star. this measured
diameter is significantly smaller than the one published by
.
the amber closure phases are all equal to zero within the error
bars. we can therefore constrain the flux of an hypothetical companion
star in addition to the central merger. to achieve that, we added a
point-source to our model and used a simulated annealing algorithm to
constrain its parameters using the observed visibilities and closure
phases and starting with random initial parameters. our conclusion is
that its flux was always smaller than 3% of the total flux,
i.e. there would be at minimum 4 magnitudes difference between primary
and secondary companion. the amber observations do not exclude the
presence of the companion, but put important constraints on its nir
contribution to the sed.
the decreasing visibilities at the edges of the  and  bands
indicate the presence of extended emission with a varying spectrum (as
shown in lower panel in fig. , blue dotted line). we
cannot constrain the exact size of this contribution due to the
plateau-like shape of visibilities as a function of spatial
frequencies, but we can provide a lower limit of its size of
 mas. we tentatively associate this emission to the
midi elongated dusty structure. the extended component would
correspond to the  and  bands contribution of the midi elongated
structure. it is noteworthy that adding this additional source of
emission does not significantly change the estimated diameter for the
central star.
to complement these measurements, we used a  spectrum of the star
from mt abu (india), obtained on 11 december 2013, to derive a
low-resolution spectrum of the central star and the extended emission
(fig. , lower panel). the stellar spectrum is typical of a
cool luminous star <cit.> with prominent first overtone co bands at
2.29  and beyond. similar, albeit weak, co second overtone
features are also seen in the  band. the deep down-turns at the
band edges are due to the presence of water in its atmosphere
. other molecular features of vo and tio
are also seen, including some rather uncommon bands of alo. the
spectrum of the extended structure shows emission bands at the  and
 band edges, where the water absorption occurs in the total
spectrum.
§ discussion
the p.a. of the major axis, as inferred from the dusty flattened
structure discovered by midi is .
the midi size increase is expected for a non-truncated dusty
disk. at the adopted distance, the dust is distributed between 150 and
400 au from v838 mon.
such findings are also in agreement with the earliest accurate
spectropolarimetric measurements reported by
. they reported an
intrinsic polarisation with a p.a. of  interpreted as scattering by a disk with a major axis at
a p.a. of .
the 2004 pti interferometric data had been interpreted as
either a uniform disk or an elliptical model, both consistently
explaining the data well. we note that the p.a.=derived from pti is roughly aligned with our longest amber baselines,
i.e. we would be sensitive to the major axis size in case the correct
 model had been that of an elongated
structure. our amber data suggest a different picture. the
supergiant has decreased in angular size by % in  years since the measurements of . the
linear radius is now estimated to   ( au). such a radius is comparable to the famous m2 iab supergiant
betelgeuse <cit.>. such an
evolution has already been suggested by . 
this diameter decrease means the star's photosphere has shrinked
during the intervening period at an approximate rate of .
the good quality of the closure phases provides crucial constraints
and excludes any secondary star brighter than a few percent of the
total flux in the 6–600 au separation range.
yet, we caution that a b3v star whose  band magnitude is fainter
than 15 would be totally undetectable by the interferometer.
the amber interferometric observations obtained 10 yr after
pti suggest a contraction of the central star by about 40%,
which is in line with the spectral change of v838 mon
toward a 'normal' m-type supergiant. no clear sign of deformation of
the photosphere is detected.
the extended emission found in the amber data is enhanced relative to
the central star around the co overtone absorption features and the
ho absorption at the band edges. this means there is water
emission around the star at an angular scale larger than 20 mas, and
smaller than 250 mas (field of view of one telescope at
2.2 ). we tentatively associate this emission to the midi
elongated dusty structure.
several hypotheses could be proposed to explain the detection of the
flattened structure at large distance, as observed by midi and
supported by amber.
the most likely hypothesis is that the flattened structure is simply
the relic of the large dust formation event as a consequence of the
merging of the two stars . the ejecta velocity was
low at outburst time – less than 200as derived from p-cygni
profiles by  from several lines. in the 10
years since outburst, ejected material would not have travelled beyond
400 au. this scenario is compatible with our finding.
the interferometric observations may also be discussed in the context
of the b3v companion discovered around v838 mon
 and observed in the
post-outburst spectra. the presence of the companion would explain the
x-ray activity discovered in the vicinity of v838 mon
. it is important to note that the distance
of this companion from the central star was investigated by
, and they estimated the minimum separation
to about 28 au. on the other hand, 
derived a separation of  au. this is well within the
separation range detectable by amber. the midi measurements
suggest a large separation of about 100 au. in 2009, the b3v hot
signature was no longer observed . we would
propose then that the companion is building a circumbinary disk via
the lagrangian point l2, as proposed in some observational and
theoretical studies on other sources .
to conclude, we find a flattened dusty structure around v838
mon. we also find that the central star decreased its diameter by
nearly 40% in 10 years.
the interferometric picture of v838 mon as of today is the
following: it is now slowly becoming an anonymous red supergiant,
surrounded by a flattened, probably transitory, dusty environment
extending up to several hundreds of au.
